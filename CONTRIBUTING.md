# Contributing to Pandora Behaviour Engine Plus
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the engine runs properly in an isolated environment.
5. Ensure the output functions properly in-game.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Unabandon Public License (a derivative of GNU GPL v3 with added clauses for publicly available source code)
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same Unabandon Public License (UPL) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/Monitor221hz/Pandora-Behaviour-Engine-Plus/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Provide media (recordings, pictures) if you can. Please note that explicit visual media is not allowed per Github's rules.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, stuff you tried that didn't work, or any mods you think are the culprit)

Developers *love* thorough bug reports!

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
Follow the [.NET code style rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/style-rules/) where possible.

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the Unabandon Public License.
